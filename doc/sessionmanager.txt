INTRODUCTION                                    *sessionmanager*

sessionmanager.vim is a simple session management plugin for vim. It saves one,
and only one session into your `~/.vim` directory when you close the editor and 
loads the previous session in once you open vim again.

COMMANDS                                        *sessionmanager-commands*

All commands are glabally available and mapped to autocommands as documented
below.

                                                *sessionmanager-:SaveSession*
:SaveSession            Saves the current session. Is called by an
                        |autocommand| at |VimLeave|.

                                                *sessionmanager-:RestoreSession*
:RestoreSession         Loads the file `$HOME/.vim/session.vim` with an 
                        |autocommand| at |VimEnter|.

USAGE                                           *sessionmanager-usage*

After copying the plugin file into the plugin folder, the plugin will 
automatically start managing your session. The `.vim` or the `vimfiles` folder
has to exist, because the plugin saves the session into this directory. It 
saves you session when you leave the editor into `$VIMDIR/session.vim` and 
reloads that session on startup. All new files from the command line (and 
buffers that are not associated with any window) will be opened into a new tab.

If you want to save the session manually you can use the command `SaveSession`
and if you want to set an autocommand to another event you can do that as well
(by default the session is only saved when the leave event is triggered, this 
can be a problem if vim closes unexpectedly).

That could look something like:

>
    augroup AddedSessionEvents
        autocmd!
        autocmd BufEnter * :SaveSession
    augroup END
<

If you for some reason want to load a session manually you can set up a mapping
to the `RestoreSession` command, even if I don't see why you should want to do
that.

That could look something like:

>
    nnoremap <leader>r :RestoreSession
<

At the moment the plugin is not configurable. Maybe this will change with my 
personal usage or preferences.
